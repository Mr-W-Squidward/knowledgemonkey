- Division Point Quiz -

This React application is a quiz game that helps users practice finding the division point (Point C) of a line segment given two points (Point A and Point B) and a ratio. The quiz presents the user with a line segment and multiple choice options for the coordinates of Point C. The user selects an option, and the application provides feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect, along with an explanation of the correct answer.
